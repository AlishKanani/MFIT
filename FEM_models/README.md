In this folder, we provide the Ansys Fluent case files used to simulate each system type and create reference FEM temperature data. There is one model for each of the 16, 36, 64, and 3D 48 chiplet systems. 

Since the case files are too large to upload to Github, the files are provided at the following link: [Case File Repository](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gE6L_D7zR-UzH7FKYe17e5gXqbQi300C?usp=sharing)

In order to repeat these simulations:
1. Import a single case file into Ansys Fluent in Solution mode
2. Initialize the simulation
3. Run
